              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies used in
              web development. HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language,
              structures the content of a webpage. It defines elements such as
              headings, paragraphs, and images. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets,
              is responsible for styling and layout. It defines how HTML
              elements should appear, including their colors, fonts, and
              positioning. JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to
              websites. It allows developers to create dynamic content, handle
              user events, and control the behavior of web elements. Together,
              these three languages form the foundation of web development.
              Without them, modern web applications wouldn't be as interactive
              or visually appealing.
